Fashion Blog is the title of this project.

Isa is a budding fashion blogger, I have built a new website for her, just in time for New York Fashion Week!

Using my new HTML knowledge, created the underlying structure of the blog.  included plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other HTML elements that Iâ€™ve learned so far.

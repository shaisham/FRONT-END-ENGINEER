In this project, I have used the knowledge gained on color theory and applied it to a simple web page. 

A grayscale website, then selected a color scheme, and applied the colors to various elements and sections within the design.
I've Used the color wheel tool for color scheme and properly paired colors together.

A color scheme:

there are multiple color schemes to select from:

Monochromatic,
Complementary
Analogous
Triadic

Used Adobe Color CC to  generate color schemes..

Pinpoint E-Commerce
In this project, I have used my gained knowledge within the Color for UI lesson and applied it to an e-commerce checkout page. In grayscale website I applied colors to various elements and sections within the design to ensure users understand the error and active states as well as primary calls-to-action.

Remember, itâ€™s important to use colors that will help them make the right decisions and provide feedback they can adequately act on.
